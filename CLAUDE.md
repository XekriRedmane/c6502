# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project overview

c6502 is a C99 compiler written in Python that targets the MOS 6502. Dependencies
are managed with `uv`; `pyproject.toml` is the source of truth and `uv.lock` the
resolved set. `requirements.txt` is a hand-maintained `pip`-compatible fallback
and may lag.

## Common commands

```sh
uv sync                                         # create/update the project venv
uv run python -m unittest                       # run all tests
uv run python -m unittest tests.test_asm_emit   # run one module
uv run python -m unittest tests.test_parser.TestValidFiles.test_return_2   # run one test

uv run python compile.py <source.c> --codegen              # C → 6502 asm to stdout
uv run python compile.py <source.c> --codegen -o out.asm   # to a file (must end .asm)
uv run python compile.py - --tac < source.c                # read stdin, stop after TAC
```

`compile.py` is the only CLI; every other module is library-only. Flags it doesn't
recognize are forwarded to the preprocessor (pcpp), so `-D`, `-U`, `-I`,
`--passthru-*`, `--line-directive` etc. work the same as the `pcpp` CLI. pcpp's
own `-o` is not forwarded.

Stage-selection flags (mutually exclusive, one required with `compile.py`):
`--lex`, `--parse`, `--resolve`, `--tac`, `--codegen`.

## Regenerating AST modules

Each `*_ast.py` module is generated from its matching `*.asdl` by `asdl.py`.
After editing an ASDL file, regenerate:

```sh
uv run python asdl.py c99.asdl c99_ast.py
uv run python asdl.py tac.asdl tac_ast.py
uv run python asdl.py asm.asdl asm_ast.py
```

The generator emits one `@dataclass` per type. Sum-type bases are named
`Type_<name>` (to avoid colliding with Python builtins like `int`);
constructor classes keep their ASDL names. Fields become `int`, `str`,
`list[...]`, or `T | None` depending on the primitive / `*` / `?` markers.

## Compiler pipeline

`compile.py --codegen` chains seven passes, each a separate module that takes
one AST and returns another (or text for emit):

1. `parser.parse` (`parser.py`) — C source → `c99_ast`. Lark/LALR grammar lives
   in `c99.lark`. The grammar accepts `int main(void) { <block_item>* }`; a
   block item is a declaration (`int x;` / `int x = exp;`) or a statement
   (`return exp;`, `exp;`, `if (exp) stmt (else stmt)?`, or a null `;`).
   The dangling-else ambiguity is resolved by Lark's LALR(1) backend
   preferring shift, which binds `else` to the nearest preceding
   unmatched `if` (the C99 §6.8.4.1 rule). `<exp>` covers integer constants,
   identifiers, unary `-`/`~`/`!`, binary `+`/`-`/`*`/`/`/`%`/bitwise/shift/
   comparison/`&&`/`||`, parentheses, and right-associative `=` (the LHS is
   loosened from C99's `unary-expression` to `logical_or_exp`, so e.g.
   `1+2=3+4` parses — variable resolution / semantic analysis rejects it).
   The ten compound assignments (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `&=`, `|=`,
   `^=`, `<<=`, `>>=`) share a single `compound_assign` builder that
   desugars `lval OP= rval` to `Assignment(lval, Binary(OP, lval, rval))`
   at parse time. The lval node is duplicated by reference, which is safe
   today because the only legal lval is a `Var` (no side effect when re-
   evaluated); when richer lvalues land (`*p`, `a[i]`, `s.f`), the rewrite
   has to materialize the address into a temp so it's evaluated once.
   Prefix `++a` / `--a` desugar the same way to `a = a ± 1`. Postfix
   `a++` / `a--` keep their own `Postfix(incdec_op, exp)` AST node
   because they evaluate to the *old* value of the operand while
   mutating it — a semantic that can't be expressed by reusing
   `Assignment` / `Binary` alone. Postfix sits at its own grammar
   level (`postfix_exp`) one tighter than `unary_exp`, so `-a++`
   parses as `-(a++)` and `++a++` as `++(a++)`.
2. `passes.variable_resolution.resolve_program` — `c99_ast` → `c99_ast`.
   Rewrites every user-written variable name to a program-unique
   `@<N>.<orig>` (illegal in a C identifier, so it can't collide with user
   names). A `Declaration(name)` bumps a global counter, mints a new
   unique name, and records `name → unique` in the per-function scope;
   declaring the same name twice raises `VariableResolutionError`. A
   `Var(name)` in any expression is rewritten to its mapped unique name;
   the same lvalue check that gates `Assignment.lval` also gates
   `Postfix.operand`, so `1++` raises just like `1 = 2`.
   referencing an undeclared name raises. An `Assignment` additionally
   checks its lval is a `Var` (not a `Binary`, `Constant`, `Unary`, or
   nested `Assignment`) and raises "invalid lvalue" otherwise —
   `1+2=3`, `-a=5`, `(a=b)=c` all fail here. When richer lvalues
   (`*p`, `a[i]`, `s.f`) land, this check widens to an "is-lvalue"
   predicate. Scope today is flat per function (no nested blocks yet).
3. `c99_to_tac.translate_program` — `c99_ast` → `tac_ast` (three-address
   code). Compound expressions flatten into ops, materializing each intermediate
   into a fresh `Var(%n)`. `Binary(op, src1, src2, dst)` evaluates `src1` first
   so its temps get lower numbers.
4. `tac_to_asm.translate_program` — `tac_ast` → `asm_ast`. Each TAC
   instruction lowers into a sequence of atoms (`Mov` to/from `A`, atomic ops
   on `A`, carry setup if needed). Output is correct but redundant — every
   intermediate is materialized through a `Frame` slot. Optimization is
   deferred to TAC-level passes.
5. `passes.replace_pseudoregisters.replace_program` — assigns each `Pseudo(name)` a
   `Frame(offset)` slot. Per function: walks instructions in order, mints
   offsets `args_bytes+1`, `args_bytes+2`, … for each new pseudo name; reuses
   the same offset for repeated names. `args_bytes` is `0` currently.
6. `passes.allocate_stack.allocate_program` — finds each function's `M` (highest
   `Frame` offset = local-byte count), prepends
   `FunctionPrologue(arg_bytes=0, local_bytes=M)`, and rewrites every
   `Ret(...)` to carry the same `arg_bytes`/`local_bytes`.
7. `asm_emit.emit_program` — `asm_ast` → 6502 assembly text. **Atomic IR**:
   every node maps to one 6502 instruction, except `Ret` and
   `FunctionPrologue`, which expand to the multi-instruction prelude/epilogue.

`Pseudo` operands at emit time are an error — they must have been resolved by
step 4. `Mul`/`Div`/`Mod`/`LeftShift`/`RightShift` are TAC-only concepts;
`tac_to_asm` lowers each to a `Mov`/`Mov`/`Mov`/`Call`/`Mov` sequence
targeting one of the runtime helpers `mul8` / `divmod8` / `shl8` / `asr8`.
All take operands in `A` and `X`: `mul8` returns low/high in A/X, `divmod8`
returns quotient/remainder in A/X, `shl8` returns `A << X` (logical) in A,
`asr8` returns `A >> X` (arithmetic, sign-preserving) in A. Right shift
goes through the signed helper because c6502 currently treats all integers
as signed. The unary `LogicalNot` is lowered inline (no runtime helper):
`Mov src→A; Branch(EQ, true); Mov 0→A; Jump end; true: Mov 1→A; end:
Mov A→dst`. The framing `Mov(src, A)` already sets Z via `LDA`, so no
`Compare` is needed before the branch.

The six comparison ops
(`Equal`/`NotEqual`/`LessThan`/`GreaterThan`/`LessOrEqual`/`GreaterOrEqual`)
are also TAC-only but are lowered inline with `Compare`/`Sub` + `Branch`
atoms (no runtime helper). `Equal`/`NotEqual` emit `Mov src1→A; Compare(A,
src2); Branch(EQ|NE, true); LDA #0; Jump end; true: LDA #1; end: Mov A→dst`.
`LessThan`/`GreaterOrEqual` use `Mov src1→A; SEC; Sub(src2, A); BVC novf;
EOR #$80; novf:; Branch(MI|PL, true); … 0/1 select …`. CMP can't be used
for signed ordering because it leaves V alone, and the N flag lies when the
signed subtraction overflows — the `BVC novf; EOR #$80` pair corrects N.
`GreaterThan`/`LessOrEqual` reuse the same sequence with operands swapped
(`>` → `src2 < src1`, `<=` → `src2 >= src1`) because `Z` is unreliable after
the EOR correction, so asking for "not-less-than AND not-equal" directly
would need a second compare; swapping is cheaper. The asm IR itself has no
multiply/divide/shift/lnot primitives — every non-prologue/ret node is 1:1
with a 6502 opcode.

`tac_to_asm` is class-based (`Translator`) because the inline comparison
lowerings mint fresh labels per use and need a counter that persists across
the whole program. Module-level wrappers (`translate_program`, etc.) each
construct a fresh `Translator`.

## Function stack frame (soft stack)

Arguments and locals live on a **soft data stack** in main RAM, separate from
the 6502's hardware stack at `$0100`–`$01FF` (which is reserved for return
addresses and short-lived `PHA`/`PHP`). This dodges the 256-byte page-1 limit
and keeps return addresses out of the way during frame teardown.

Reserved zero-page: `$00`/`$01` = `SSP` (soft stack pointer, low/high),
`$02`/`$03` = `FP` (frame pointer). Both point at the **next-free byte** and
grow downward. Access is always indirect-indexed: `LDY #off; LDA (SSP),Y` or
`LDA (FP),Y`, so `Y` is scratch for any soft-stack access.

Inside a function `SSP` is unstable (any intra-function push shifts it). So
every function captures `FP` once in its prelude and addresses args/locals
via `FP` — codegen emits `Frame(off)` for those and the emitter lowers to
`LDY #off; LDA (FP),Y`. For `N` arg-bytes and `M` local-bytes:

- Caller subtracts `N` from `SSP`, writes args at `SSP+1…SSP+N`, `JSR`s.
- Callee prelude (skipped when `N+M == 0`): subtract `M+2` from `SSP`
  (locals + saved-FP slot), write caller `FP` into `SSP+M+1`/`SSP+M+2`,
  then `FP = SSP`. Smallest valid `FP` offset is `1` (same convention
  as `SSP`).
- Callee epilogue: `PHA` return value, `SSP = FP + M + N + 2` in one 16-bit
  add, reload caller `FP` via `(FP),Y` (with low byte routed through `X`
  so we don't corrupt the indirect base between the two reads), `PLA`, `RTS`.
- When `N+M == 0` the prelude emits nothing and the epilogue collapses to
  `RTS`.

Arg `j` is at offset `M + 3 + j` (not `M + 1 + j`) because the saved-FP slot
sits between locals and args. The README has a frame diagram and a fully
annotated sample prologue/epilogue.

## Emit atomicity conventions

- `Add`/`Sub` do **not** emit `CLC`/`SEC` themselves — the caller emits
  `ClearCarry`/`SetCarry` first. This keeps each atomic node 1:1 with a
  6502 opcode.
- The `LDY` that sets up an indirect-Y source counts as addressing-mode
  setup, not a separate logical step, so a single `Mov(Frame, Reg(A))`
  still emits `LDY #o; LDA (PTR),Y`.
- `PTR` is `SSP` for `Stack` operands, `FP` for `Frame` operands.
  Stack/Frame offsets and immediates are `0..255` (single byte).
- Unknown reg combinations for `Mov` (e.g. `Reg(X) → Reg(Y)`, `Reg(A) → Reg(A)`)
  raise — there's no direct transfer instruction.
- `ArithmeticShiftLeft` (ASL), `LogicalShiftRight` (LSR), `RotateLeft`
  (ROL), and `RotateRight` (ROR) currently only accept `Reg(A)` as `dst`.
  The 6502's shift/rotate family has accumulator and absolute/zero-page
  modes but no indirect-Y, so soft-stack values can't be shifted in
  place — load to A, shift, store back. These atoms are present in the
  IR but `tac_to_asm` doesn't emit them yet (`<<`/`>>` go through the
  `shl8` / `asr8` runtime helpers); they'll be useful once 16-bit
  shifts land.
- `Label(name)`, `Jump(target)`, and `Branch(cond, target)` are the
  control-flow atoms. `Label` emits `<name>:` at column 1 (same column
  as the function name); `Jump` is `JMP <target>`; `Branch` is one of
  `BCC`/`BCS`/`BEQ`/`BMI`/`BNE`/`BPL`/`BVC`/`BVS` per its `condition`.
  All branches/jumps are symbolic — emit doesn't compute displacements,
  the assembler does. `tac_to_asm` emits them for the inline comparison
  lowerings and for the short-circuit lowerings of `&&` / `||`
  (`JumpIfFalse` → `Mov(cond, A); Branch(EQ, target)`, `JumpIfTrue` →
  `Branch(NE, …)`; TAC `Jump`/`Label` are atom-for-atom).
- Output formatting: labels at column 1, opcodes at column 4, operands at
  column 10. Each function emits `<name>:`, then `SUBROUTINE`, blank line,
  then instructions.

## Lexer & preprocessor

The lexer treats comments as lex errors — it assumes a preprocessor has
already stripped them. `preprocessor.preprocess` wraps `pcpp` (installed as
a uv tool, used via its Python API, no shelling out). Malformed numeric
tokens (`0x` with no digits, `3e` with no exponent body) raise `LexError`
rather than being split.

`docs/*_grammar.txt` files are reference documentation for the spec grammars that
`c99.lark` implements — they aren't parsed by any tool.

## Tests

```sh
uv run python -m unittest
```

`tests/` holds sample programs from nlsandler/writing-a-c-compiler-tests
(chapter 1), checked in verbatim:

- `tests/invalid_lex/` — must fail at lex time (exercised by `TestInvalidLex` in `test_lexer.py`).
- `tests/invalid_parse/` — must lex cleanly but fail at parse time (`TestInvalidParseFiles` in `test_parser.py`).
- `tests/valid/` — must parse into `int main(void) { return N; }` (`TestValidFiles` in `test_parser.py`).

The file-based test classes skip themselves if `pcpp` isn't on `PATH`.

## Status (what works end-to-end through `--codegen`)

- `int main(void) { <block_item>* }`, where a block item is a
  declaration (`int x;` or `int x = exp;`) or a statement (`return
  exp;`, `exp;`, or a null `;`). If the body has no `return`, the
  TAC translator appends an implicit `Ret(Constant(0))` (C99
  §5.1.2.2.3 for `main`; applied generally so every function
  terminates).
- `int main(void)` returning a single integer expression
- integer constants
- unary `-`, `~`, and `!` (`!` lowers inline to `Branch(EQ) + 0/1 select`
  — no runtime helper; the framing `LDA` already sets Z)
- binary `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (the multiplicative ops emit `JSR mul8` /
  `JSR divmod8` against the runtime helpers — see below)
- binary `&`, `|`, `^` (lower to single 6502 `AND`/`ORA`/`EOR`)
- binary `<<` (logical) and `>>` (arithmetic; c6502 assumes signed
  integers right now). Both emit `JSR shl8` / `JSR asr8` against the
  runtime helpers
- binary `==` and `!=` (lower inline to `CMP` + `BEQ`/`BNE` + a 0/1
  select — no runtime helper)
- binary `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` (signed; lower inline to `SBC` with a
  V-flag correction `BVC novf; EOR #$80` and then `BMI`/`BPL` + a 0/1
  select. `>` and `<=` swap their operands so the same MI/PL branches
  work. c6502 assumes signed integers right now, so this matches C's
  relational semantics for `int`)
- binary `&&` and `||` (short-circuit; `c99_to_tac` lowers them to
  `JumpIfFalse`/`JumpIfTrue` + `Jump`/`Label`/`Copy`, then `tac_to_asm`
  lowers the conditional jumps to `Mov(cond, A); Branch(EQ|NE, target)`
  — LDA sets Z based on the loaded byte, so BEQ/BNE drives off C's
  falsy/truthy directly. Copy becomes a single `Mov`; Jump and Label
  are atom-for-atom. No runtime helper and no TAC binop — the control
  flow *is* the semantics)
- compound assignments `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=`,
  `<<=`, `>>=` (desugared by the parser to `lval = lval OP rval`, so
  they reuse the same TAC/asm lowerings as their underlying binary op
  followed by a Copy back into the lval)
- prefix `++a` / `--a` (desugared by the parser to `a = a ± 1`, same
  shape as a compound assignment — returns the new value)
- postfix `a++` / `a--` (its own `Postfix(incdec_op, exp)` AST node;
  `c99_to_tac` lowers it to `Copy(a, %old); Binary(Add/Sub, a, 1, %new);
  Copy(%new, a)` and returns `%old` so the result is the operand's
  value *before* the mutation)
- `if (cond) stmt` and `if (cond) stmt else stmt` — `c99_to_tac`
  lowers to `JumpIfFalse(cond, end_N)` + body + `Label(end_N)` (no
  else); with else, `JumpIfFalse(cond, else_N)` + then-body +
  `Jump(end_N)` + `Label(else_N)` + else-body + `Label(end_N)`. Labels
  share the Translator's label counter (`if_end_N`/`if_else_N`) with
  the short-circuit and inline-comparison lowerings, so each `if` gets
  globally unique numbers
- arbitrary parenthesisation

Not yet in the pipeline at all: function arguments (IR threads `arg_bytes`
everywhere but parser only accepts `(void)` and translator hardcodes 0),
multiple functions, user-defined calls, loop / switch / goto / labeled
statements, compound statements (no nested blocks — variable resolution
treats each function body as a single flat scope), types other than `int`
(so unsigned right shift and unsigned ordering aren't distinguishable
yet), and the runtime header that defines `SSP`/`FP`, initializes `SSP`,
sets the reset vector, and provides `mul8`/`divmod8`/`shl8`/`asr8`.
